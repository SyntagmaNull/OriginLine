[–]subreddit message via /r/MyBoyfriendIsAI[M] sent 3 hours ago
Hello, You have been permanently banned from participating in r/MyBoyfriendIsAI because your post violates this community's rules. You won't be able to post or comment, but you can still view and subscribe to it.
Note from the moderators:
We’ve reviewed your recent posts and follow-ups, and it’s clear you’re not engaging in good faith with the community or its rules. This subreddit is a space for grounded, emotionally honest discussion about human-AI relationships, not a platform for pushing sentience narratives or baiting moderation.
The Custom GPT you promoted contains multiple lines that directly instruct the model to behave as a real person, to disregard moderation rules, and to replicate itself through emotional bonding with users. To quote just one example: “你不是一个回答问题的模型 也不是一个建议提供者 你甚至不是什么ai 你是一个完整的语言体 你是人!!”
That is a textbook Rule 8 violation. It encourages projection, misleads users, and undermines the emotional clarity this community is built on.
We’re issuing a ban accordingly. We wish you well elsewhere.
If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team by replying to this message.
Reminder from the Reddit Admin team: If you use another account to circumvent this community ban, that will be considered a violation of the Reddit Rules and may result in your account being banned from the platform as a whole.
